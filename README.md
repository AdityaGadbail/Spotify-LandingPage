# Spotify Landing Page

A simple, responsive landing page clone inspired by Spotify's marketing pages. This repository contains the static HTML, CSS, and assets for a single-page landing site meant for demonstration, learning, or portfolio use.

## Contents

- `index.html` — the main HTML page.
- `style.css` — styles for the landing page.
- `assets/` — images and other static assets used by the page.

## Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean, modern hero section and calls-to-action
- Lightweight, no build step required (pure HTML/CSS)

## Folder structure

```
.
├─ index.html
├─ style.css
└─ assets/
	└─ ... (images, icons)
```

## How to view locally

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with a tiny local server (recommended for consistent asset loading).

1) Open file directly

 - Double-click `index.html` or right-click -> Open in Browser.

2) Quick local server (Python 3)

```powershell
# from the project root (where index.html is)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

3) Using the VS Code Live Server extension

- Install the Live Server extension and click "Go Live" in the status bar.

## Customize

- Edit `index.html` to change text and structure.
- Modify `style.css` to tweak colors, spacing, or typography.
- Replace images inside `assets/` with your own while keeping the same file names or updating references in the HTML.

## Notes

- This project is intended as a static landing page example—no backend, authentication, or streaming integration.
- If you plan to reuse any Spotify trademarks or assets publicly, check Spotify's brand guidelines.
